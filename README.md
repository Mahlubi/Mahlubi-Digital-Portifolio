 Introduction

This Digital Portfolio showcases my professional and personal development as an ICT student at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology (CPUT). It highlights my competencies in Business Communication, Interview Skills, Professional Networking, Mock Interview, and Workplace Etiquette.

The portfolio reflects my readiness for the workplace by presenting evidence of learning and reflections structured using the STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) technique.

Each section demonstrates growth in areas that contribute to my employability and professional image in the ICT industry.

Curriculum Vitae (CV)


Reflection (STAR Technique)

Situation:
During my Work Readiness module, I was required to prepare professional documents such as a CV, cover letter, and formal email as part of applying for a potential ICT internship.

Task:
To create clear, formal business communication documents that reflect professionalism and align with workplace expectations.

Action:
I used a modern CV template and ensured that my personal information, education, and skills were presented clearly. I wrote a targeted cover letter using appropriate language and formatting. I also drafted a professional email to demonstrate how to communicate formally with potential employers.

Result:
I improved my ability to write professional business documents and communicate confidently in a formal environment. I received positive feedback from my lecturer, and I now have polished documents ready for job applications.
